Project 2 Cosmo - Kymira Recycling App

The purpose of this project is to create a mobile application that will encourage users to be more informed recyclers at locations where Cosmo offers MURR pick ups.
The app will provide users with information on recyclable and non-recyclable materials and reward them for avoiding contaminating their recycling bins.
