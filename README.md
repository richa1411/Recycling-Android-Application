# README #

## BEFORE YOUR FIRST COMMIT: ##

Make sure your entire team is on board with folder/naming schemes for your project. Capitalization matters, too, so make sure you're all in sync on that.

Establish your .gitignore file and be in agreement on that. For many projects, you'll want to use an existing .gitignore file (many frameworks will have a "recommended .gitignore" setup, and it is fine to use that), but at least look and make sure you know what is in it before using it.

Finally, change this README file to include the name and description of your project, and to include information on naming conventions, folder structure, and the like that all contributing group members should follow.

Once you've done that, speak to your supervisor to enable write access to your project for your team so you can make your first commit.
